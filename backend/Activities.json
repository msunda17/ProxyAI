Handouts were created and handed out to the dental students who volunteer to better educate them about patients they see that could also benefit from PT. A working relationship has been established with dental in hopes that this inter-disciplinary relationship will continue when we both are at the new clinic as it will be easier to get referrals. \n \u2022 PT and OT have been working with Medicine to establish a protocol for PT &OT students being down in the medicine room to listen in as medical students\u2019 brief their faculty about patients. This was established in hopes to find additional patients who can benefit from PT services and educate the other disciplines on patients who would be appropriate for our services. \n o \u201cThis year, the SOC has implemented 'PT in the Med Room' with the goal of improving patient care through inter-professional collaboration. Every UIndy student that has been involved in the medical room mentioned having a positive experience. These experiences range from providing insight to medical students in regards to musculoskeletal presentations, collaborating on interventions that are holistic in nature, and advocating for the PT profession. With the state of healthcare becoming more reliant on inter-professional collaboration, every student involved in this project has a head start for optimizing their practice and patient outcomes.\" \u2013Andrew Wilson (UIndy PT Clinic Manager 2017)\n \u2022 IU and UIndy students interested in Women\u2019s Health have partnered with Medicine on Women\u2019s Health Days to both treat and educate on women\u2019s health issues.  \n \u2022 Worked with all the partners at the clinic in establishing the layout for the new clinic.\n \n\n Research \n \u2022 December 2017, Courtney Larson (IU) & Piper Prange (IU) were invited to speak at the IUPUI Plater Institute Luncheon about the \u201cImpact of Community Engagement on Student Learning: Student Perspectives\u201d. They had the opportunity to present the poster mentioned above as well as talk with educators about how their time on the PT board at the SOC and volunteering there has impacted their learning and views on civic engagement. \n \u2022 January & February 2017, Courtney Larson (IU) and Piper Prange (IU) presented a poster from research done at the clinic titled \u201cThe Community as a Classroom: Curricular Assessment of Students\u2019 Civic-Mindedness as a Function of Volunteerism\u201d in January at the Indiana APTA (INAPTA) Central District Meeting and in February at the APTA Combined Sections Meeting (CSM), receiving a ribbon for social responsibility from the Global Health SIG.",

        "description":"<p>This community engaged activity was a collaboration between the interior architecture department and the African American Diaspora Studies (AADS) program at UNCG, and the International Civil Rights Center and Museum (ICRCM).<\/p><p>On April, 2023 the ICRCM had an opening night for the &quot;Design Activism: Imagining Spaces for Social Justice, Peace, and Reconciliation&quot; exhibition.&nbsp;The&nbsp;exhibition showcased the creative designs of interior architecture students who were tasked with creating a museum and memorial space dedicated to Eugene Hairston. Eugene Hairston was a young black teenager from a sharecropping family and the sole documented lynch victim in Guilford County during the era of segregation. Despite no evidence supporting the accusation that he attacked a young white woman, he found himself in jail awaiting trial. Tragically, a mob of masked men forcibly released him from his cell and lynched him on the outskirts of town.<\/p><p>The exhibition&nbsp; plays a role in Guildford County&#39;s efforts to reclaim its lynching marker from the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama. The Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) founded this memorial in 2018, aiming to create a meaningful site for reflection on America&#39;s history of racial inequality. The memorial includes a public square with 800 steel markers, one for each county where lynching occurred, bearing the names of the victims. To reclaim a replica of their marker, counties are encouraged to engage in knowledge generation and healing around the topic of lynching, focusing on &quot;the truth of things&quot; to promote accountability and healing.<\/p><p>The students&rsquo; work and the exhibition&#39;s curation were the result of a collaborative effort between Dr. Asha Kutty&nbsp;from the department of interior architecture&nbsp; Dr. Noelle Morrissette from the African American diaspora studies (AADS) program, and Dr. Deborah Barnes, an onsite research scholar at the ICRCM who is taking the lead in reclaiming Guildford County&rsquo;s lynching marker. With the assistance of students from the AADS program, interior architecture students created design proposals for the museum and memorial space dedicated to Eugene Hairston. Thirteen proposals were submitted, and ten were chosen for exhibition, each offering unique perspectives on the story and context of Eugene Hairston.<\/p><p>Additionally, the students&#39; work will serve as valuable resources for an upcoming summer camp, which aims to inspire local high school minority students interested in pursuing interior design careers. Some of the students involved in the exhibition will act as mentors during this camp. This collaboration&#39;s ultimate goal is to establish a tiered educational pathway, fostering socially responsive approaches to interior design education.<\/p>",
