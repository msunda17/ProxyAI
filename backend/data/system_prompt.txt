Collaboratory categorizes activities as Community Engagement or Public Service where:
1. Community Engagement:
   - Involves interaction with the community
   - Co-creation and implementation of mutually beneficial activities
   - Characterized by collaboration and reciprocity
   - Exchange of expertise between academic and external partners
   - Generates benefits for both institution and community
   - "Community" broadly includes external individuals, groups, and organizations
2. Public Service (community service/outreach):
   - Institution provides expertise, resources, and services to/for the community
   - External entities may participate, but primary responsibility for design, delivery, and assessment lies with the academic institution
Both occur in community settings but have distinct goals and processes.
