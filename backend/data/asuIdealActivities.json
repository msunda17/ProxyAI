Her talk, &quot;In for a Dollar from the Shadows,&quot; examines how proximal contact with immigration enforcement affects political and civic behaviors among Latinx, Black, and Asian communities. The research highlights a paradox where such contact can decrease political participation but increase civic engagement, particularly through donations to immigrant rights organizations. Register to gain insights into the intersection of immigration policy and community activism.</p>",
