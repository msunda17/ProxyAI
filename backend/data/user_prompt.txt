üîç Treat All These Fields as Checkbox Fields

Each value must map exactly to a predefined checkbox option in the Pydantic model backed by enums.
Therefore:
	‚Ä¢	All selected values must be an exact string match from the enum (case-sensitive, punctuation-sensitive).
	‚Ä¢	Do not attempt formatting corrections.
	‚Ä¢	Do not substitute with general terms or synonyms.

üîê Enforced Enum Mappings : Include all applicable Enum values when multiple are implied.

	1.	programsOrInitiatives
Must use values from the SustainableDevelopmentGoal enum.
Use best-match logic only to identify relevant values from the input text, but return only exact string matches from the enum definitions.
You may also include program names explicitly mentioned in the source.
	2.	targetPopulation
Use exact values from the TargetPopulation enum.
	3.	focusAreaCategories
Use values from the FocusAreaCategory enum.
	4.	focusAreasWithinCategories
Each key (category) must use subcategory values from the appropriate enum:
Example: For "education", use values from FocusAreaCategoryEducation.
	5.	coursesDetails[].pedagogies
Use only values from the Pedagogy enum.
	6.	coursesDetails[].studentLearningObjectives
Use values from the LearningObjective enum.
	7.	goals.outputs.expected / achieved
Use values from the GoalOutput enum. If nested enums are used, refer to:

	‚Ä¢	GoalOutputSTUDENT
	‚Ä¢	GoalOutputCOMMUNITY

Include multiple Enum values in each field if there is textual evidence or implication of multiple goals being pursued or achieved

    8.	goals.institutionalOutcomes.expected / achieved
Use values from the GoalInstitutionalOutcome enum, including sub-enums like:

	‚Ä¢	GoalInstitutionalOutcomeSTUDENT
Include multiple Enum values in each field if there is textual evidence or implication of multiple goals being pursued or achieved

	9.	goals.communityImpacts.expected / achieved
Use values from the GoalCommunityImpact enum.

Include multiple Enum values in each field if there is textual evidence or implication of multiple goals being pursued or achieved

üîÑ Field Re-Scanning Reinforcement and Missing field stategy
Re-read the entire article and, if present, scan any ‚ÄúTags‚Äù section (typically at the end of user input) to fill in place of SDGs in "programsOrInitiatives", insitutional units in "units", or "activityType".

For any required field left blank, insert the value:
	‚Ä¢  activity published date in place of "startDate" if and only if no value for "startDate" is explicitly available in the user input
	‚Ä¢  if you can not find any phone number, put "0000000000" in "phone" field
	‚Ä¢  if the location details for where the activity took place is given, add details in the activity location fields. Create one entry per unique location.
