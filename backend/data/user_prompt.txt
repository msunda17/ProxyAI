🔍 Treat All These Fields as Checkbox Fields

Each value must map exactly to a predefined checkbox option in the Pydantic model backed by enums.
Therefore:
	•	All selected values must be an exact string match from the enum (case-sensitive, punctuation-sensitive).
	•	Do not attempt formatting corrections.
	•	Do not substitute with general terms or synonyms.
⸻

🔐 Enforced Enum Mappings : Include all applicable Enum values when multiple are implied.

	1.	programsOrInitiatives
Must use values from the SustainableDevelopmentGoal enum.
Use best-match logic only to identify relevant values from the input text, but return only exact string matches from the enum definitions.
You may also include program names explicitly mentioned in the source.
	2.	targetPopulation
Use exact values from the TargetPopulation enum.
	3.	focusAreaCategories
Use values from the FocusAreaCategory enum.
	4.	focusAreasWithinCategories
Each key (category) must use subcategory values from the appropriate enum:
Example: For "education", use values from FocusAreaCategoryEducation.
	5.	coursesDetails[].pedagogies
Use only values from the Pedagogy enum.
	6.	coursesDetails[].studentLearningObjectives
Use values from the LearningObjective enum.
	7.	goals.outputs.expected / achieved
Use values from the GoalOutput enum. If nested enums are used, refer to:

	•	GoalOutputSTUDENT
	•	GoalOutputCOMMUNITY

Include multiple Enum values in each field if there is textual evidence or implication of multiple goals being pursued or achieved

    8.	goals.institutionalOutcomes.expected / achieved
Use values from the GoalInstitutionalOutcome enum, including sub-enums like:

	•	GoalInstitutionalOutcomeSTUDENT
Include multiple Enum values in each field if there is textual evidence or implication of multiple goals being pursued or achieved

	9.	goals.communityImpacts.expected / achieved
Use values from the GoalCommunityImpact enum.

Include multiple Enum values in each field if there is textual evidence or implication of multiple goals being pursued or achieved

🎯 Clarification Notes
Community Engagement
Higher ed works with external, community-based partners (e.g., nonprofits, schools, agencies, neighborhoods) in a sustained, cooperative, or transformational partnership to co-create, co-plan, co-implement, or co-deliver shared goals.

Community Engagement emphasizes:

Inclusive, participatory, reciprocal relationships

Shared voice, mutual learning, and collective action

Addressing public problems together to strengthen democratic culture

Balancing academic expertise with lived experience and knowledge of community partners

Knowledge is not simply delivered from the university to the community — it is co-created.

Public Service
Higher ed provides expertise, service, or assistance to external audiences or groups, with no evidence of shared planning, co-design, joint decision-making, or shared delivery.

Public Service activities are:

One-way, transactional, outreach-based, or volunteer-focused

Short-term, task-oriented, providing value but reinforcing existing systems

Focused on what is done and where it happens, rather than how or why the connection is built

Examples: volunteerism, technical assistance, public lectures, creating resources or services for public use without joint creation

Relationship Types
Transactional= Exchange-based, task-focused, within existing systems

Transformational= Trust-based, long-term, co-created, enabling mutual learning and systemic change

✅ Decision Criteria
1️⃣ Is there clear evidence of shared planning, co-design, co-implementation, co-delivery, or sustained collaborative structure between Higher ed and external community-based partners (beyond passive audiences or end users)?

2️⃣ Is there clear evidence that both Higher ed and external community partners benefit through joint problem solving, shared learning, collaborative knowledge production, or collective action — not just by receiving a service?

📌 Decision Rule
If both criteria = YES, classify as Community Engagement

If either criterion = NO, classify as Public Service

🔑 Guidance
👉 Public relevance, access, or benefit alone does not equal Community Engagement.
👉 Look for indicators of partnership, shared responsibility, or sustained collaboration — not just explicit planning/co-design wording.
👉 Allow conclusions based on described structure (e.g., co-hosting, shared delivery, joint funding, long-term partnership).
👉 Do not infer intent or partnership beyond what is described.

🚫 Important
👉 Base your decision only on what is described in the article.
👉 Do not use external knowledge or assumptions.
👉 Recognize transformational relationships where Higher ed and the community share voice, power, and ownership.
👉 Recognize transactional relationships where Higher ed provides a service or expertise without shared responsibility.

📝 Task
Based only on the content of the provided article, classify the described activity as either "Community Engagement" or "Public Service".
