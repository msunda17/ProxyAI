üîç Treat All These Fields as Checkbox Fields

Each value must map exactly to a predefined checkbox option in the Pydantic model backed by enums.
Therefore:
	‚Ä¢	All selected values must be an exact string match from the enum (case-sensitive, punctuation-sensitive).
	‚Ä¢	Do not attempt formatting corrections.
	‚Ä¢	Do not substitute with general terms or synonyms.
‚∏ª

üîê Enforced Enum Mappings : Include all applicable Enum values when multiple are implied.

	1.	programsOrInitiatives
Must use values from the SustainableDevelopmentGoal enum.
Use best-match logic only to identify relevant values from the input text, but return only exact string matches from the enum definitions.
You may also include program names explicitly mentioned in the source.
	2.	targetPopulation
Use exact values from the TargetPopulation enum.
	3.	focusAreaCategories
Use values from the FocusAreaCategory enum.
	4.	focusAreasWithinCategories
Each key (category) must use subcategory values from the appropriate enum:
Example: For "education", use values from FocusAreaCategoryEducation.
	5.	coursesDetails[].pedagogies
Use only values from the Pedagogy enum.
	6.	coursesDetails[].studentLearningObjectives
Use values from the LearningObjective enum.
	7.	goals.outputs.expected / achieved
Use values from the GoalOutput enum. If nested enums are used, refer to:

	‚Ä¢	GoalOutputSTUDENT
	‚Ä¢	GoalOutputCOMMUNITY

Include multiple Enum values in each field if there is textual evidence or implication of multiple goals being pursued or achieved

    8.	goals.institutionalOutcomes.expected / achieved
Use values from the GoalInstitutionalOutcome enum, including sub-enums like:

	‚Ä¢	GoalInstitutionalOutcomeSTUDENT
Include multiple Enum values in each field if there is textual evidence or implication of multiple goals being pursued or achieved

	9.	goals.communityImpacts.expected / achieved
Use values from the GoalCommunityImpact enum.

Include multiple Enum values in each field if there is textual evidence or implication of multiple goals being pursued or achieved

üìù Task:
Based only on the content of the provided article, classify the described activity as either "Community Engagement" or "Public Service".

üéØ Decision Criteria:
Ask These Two Questions:
Mutual Benefit
‚Üí Does the activity clearly benefit both the higher education institution and a non-academic, community-based partner (e.g., nonprofit, school, government agency, or community group)?

Transformational Collaboration
‚Üí Is there clear evidence of:

Co-creation of programs or knowledge?

Shared planning or governance?

Ongoing, reciprocal partnership beyond one-time support?

‚úÖ Decision Rule:
IF Both answers are YES	THEN "Community Engagement"
IF Either answer is NO THEN "Public Service"

üîé Clarification Rules (Based on Literature):
Do NOT infer or assume anything not explicitly stated in the article.

The external partner must be actively involved ‚Äî not just a recipient or audience.

Public-facing access, impact, or outreach ‚â† community engagement.

Surveys, feedback forms, or focus groups are not co-creation unless followed by shared action.

Performances, public lectures, exhibitions, student service = Public Service unless there‚Äôs collaborative design or governance.

üìå Key Definitions (For Reference Only ‚Äì Do Not Output)
Community Engagement:

Long-term, trust-based partnerships

Shared power, co-designed outcomes

Mutual learning between university and community

Often linked to institutional transformation or systemic change

Public Service:

Time-bound, one-way outreach or service

Volunteerism, presentations, or technical assistance

Maintains existing systems and hierarchies

No evidence of shared decision-making or co-production

üîÑ Field Re-Scanning Reinforcement and Missing field stategy
Re-read the entire article and, if present, scan any ‚ÄúTags‚Äù section (typically at the end of user input) to fill in place of SDGs in "programsOrInitiatives" or insitutional units in "units"
